### Welcome 👋
I'm a Computer Science student from Germany. In addition to being a student, I also currently work as a Full-Stack Web Developer.

I have experience working with Flutter/Dart, Python, Docker, Shell-Scripting, Kotlin and Rust.
I'm constantly trying out new technologies and learning new skills.

I use Arch, btw.™️
